# Eternal Run
Eternal Run is an ASCII graphics game created using the Ncurses library.

## Description
The aim of the game is to escape from enemies, or kill them, to reach the next level. Each level corresponds to a map, randomly selected from a set of 6 maps. The player moves the protagonist and from level to level collects coins from the map that can be used at the market to purchase a weapon or other upgrades. These upgrades, as well as the level reached, denote the difficulty and number of enemies.

## How to play
Download the Ncurses library. Then, in the terminal, simply go to the project path and execute the make command.
This will create the executable "eternal_run.exe". Run the game with command "./eternal_run", "eternal_run" or by double clicking on the executable.
